    -

## Object Basics

    -**All about object literals, and object basics like encapsulation, properties, methods, and classes.**
    -Putting all of these properties and methods into a package and attaching it to a variable is called         **encapsulation**.

### Dot Notation & Bracket Notation

    -Able to use Dot notation by  varibleName.Property E.g. dog.color / dog.bark(); ~  when calling a function make sure to use ()
    -You could store a property name inside a variable and use bracket notation with the variable instead.This is really useful if you need to use or generate dynamic properties.
