## Introduction to Object-Oriented JavaScript

- Object Real Life Example: **House** = Object, **Properties** = Square Footage, Color, Year Built, **Methods** = Paint House, Build Pool

## Object Basics

- All about object literals, and object basics like encapsulation, properties, methods, and classes.
- Putting all of these properties and methods into a package and attaching it to a variable is called **Encapsulation**.

### Dot Notation & Bracket Notation

- Able to use Dot notation by variableName.Property E.g. dog.color / dog.bark();
- when calling a function make sure to use ()
- You could store a property name inside a variable and use bracket notation with the variable instead.This is really useful if you need to use or generate dynamic properties.
